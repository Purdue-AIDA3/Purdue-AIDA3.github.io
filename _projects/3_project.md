## Overview

This project is aimed at augmenting the capabilities for ground operations at airports by developing a fully automated taxiing system for fixed-wing aircraft. The project will leverage advanced technologies in robotics, artificial intelligence, controls engineering, and sensor integration to create an autonomous system capable of navigating complex airport environments safely and efficiently. Key components include path planning algorithm that will select the optimal path for both hanger-to-runway and runway-to-hanger taxiing operations and a low-level controller that will ensure the path is navigated autonomously while handling real-time collision avoidance with potential obstacles using control barrier functions. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to enable one human operator to control and coordinate the taxing operations of multiple autonomous aircraft simultaneously. First steps towards achieving this goal include demonstrating our auto-taxing framework in simulation, then experimentally at a small scale for fixed wing aircraft in the Purdue UAS Research and Testing (PURT) facility.
